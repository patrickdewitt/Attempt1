				I have an iPhone
			</h3>
			<p>
				I've been on the Apple bandwagon ever since the first iPhone came out in 20XX. I've been relitivily pleased with the devices upgrading to a 3G and now a 4. Fast foward two years and now it is time to upgrade. Naturally I was intrigued by the 5S upon annouancment however I was quite disapointed with the lack of features. I am considering switching to the Android platfrom.

				Being the most deliberative person I've ever come to know I have spent a great deal of time in the last week, researching the diferent OS and the various players. I've compiled a vast array of infromation, opinions and formed some of my own. Even took a trip to Best Buy to get real down and dirty. This site is a result of my deliberation disorder. This site will alleviate some of the scale tention in my head (as well as help me practive code!:)
