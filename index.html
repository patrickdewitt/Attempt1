				I have an iPhone 4
			</h3>
			<p>
				I've been on the Apple bandwagon ever since the first iPhone came out in 20XX. I've been relitivily pleased with the devices upgrading to a 3G and now a 4. Fast foward two years and now it is time to upgrade. Naturally I was intrigued by the 5S upon annouancment however I was quite disapointed with the lack of features. I am considering switching to the Android platfrom.

				Being the most deliberative person I've ever come to know, I have spent a time in the last week researching different devices. I have compiled on this site some stats with pros and cons about each device.
