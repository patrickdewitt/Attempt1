					I've been on the Apple bandwagon ever since the first iPhone came out in 2006. I've been relitivily pleased with the devices upgrading to a 3G and now a 4. Fast foward two years and now it is time to upgrade. Naturally I was intrigued by the 5S upon annouancment however I was quite disapointed with the lack of features. I am considering switching to the Android platfrom.

					Being the most deliberative person I've ever come to know, I have spent a time in the last week researching different devices. I have compiled on this site some stats with pros and cons about each device.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are the smartphones I'll be comparing.
					<ul>
						<li>iPhone 5s</li>
						<li>HTC One</li>
						<li>LG Nexus 5</li>
						<li>Motorola Moto X</li>
					</ul>
					Let's get into it!
